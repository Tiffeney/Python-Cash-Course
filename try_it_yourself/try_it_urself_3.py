#3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names . Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, 
# one at a time.

best_friends = ["whiteney", "asia", "betsy", "meshia", "kristi"]
print(best_friends[0])
print(best_friends[1])
print(best_friends[2])
print(best_friends[3])
print(best_friends[4])

#3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them . 
# The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

print(best_friends[0] + 'is my sister/bestfreind')




#3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, 
# and make a list that stores several examples . Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as 
# “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
